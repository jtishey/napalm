Changes from the main NAPALM release
=====================================

Added NAPALM.py to handle driver import and connection
    USE:  from napalm import NAPALM
          dev = NAPALM.open('hostname')

    Requires 2 custom packages: ltoken and get_os to provide
    information needed by the driver.


Modified napalm/ios/ios.py to allow sending config commands
    Doesn't follow the abstraction model of NAPALM for configuring
    devices, but the method of copying a config file with specific
    structure and then doing a merge/replace is very uncomfortable.

    USE: dev.config_commands(['list of', 'config commands'])
    RETURNS: String output from the list of config commands
    NEW METHOD: config_commands = Type check list and call _send_config_set wrapper
               _send_config_set = Execute via netmiko "send_config_set"


Modified napalm/ios/ios.py to allow saving running config to startup
    Because of the previous modification, provide a way to save config
    
    USE: dev.save_config()
    RETRUNS: String output of the "write memory" command
    NEW METHOD: save_config - Execute "write memory" via netmiko "save_config"


Added napalm/sros to add some basic functionality for Nokia SR-OS
    Modified base.py to not check for enable mode on SROS because of some issues checking that
